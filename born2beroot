1. VIRTUAL MACHINE
- What is it?
  * Software that simulates dedicated hardware to create virtual computer
  * Allows running multiple OS on single physical machine
  * Uses host's CPU, RAM, storage but in isolated environment
- Purpose:
  * Testing and development environments
  * Server consolidation (multiple servers on one machine)
  * Save physical space
  * Maintenance
  * Cost effective resource usage
  * Easy backup and recovery

2. WHY DEBIAN?
- Reasons for choice:
  * Very stable and reliable (thoroughly tested updates)
  * Excellent security track record
  * Simple and efficient package management (apt)
  * Huge software repository
  * Great documentation and community support
  * Lower resource requirements
  * Free and open source

3. DEBIAN VS ROCKY
- Key differences:
  * Package Management:
    - Debian: APT (.deb packages)
    - Rocky: DNF/YUM (.rpm packages)
  * Release Cycle:
    - Debian: Regular releases, stable branch
    - Rocky: Long term support (10 years)
  * Default Security:
    - Debian: AppArmor
    - Rocky: SELinux
  * Target Usage:
    - Debian: General purpose, servers
    - Rocky: Enterprise servers

4. PACKAGE MANAGERS
- apt vs aptitude:
  * apt:
    - Defualt linux package tool
    - Only does exactly what you tell it
    - Manual dependency handling
    - No memory of package installation reason
    - More straightforward, but less automated
  
  * aptitude:
    - More sophisticated package manager
    - Remembers which packages were:
      > Explicitly installed by user
      > Automatically installed as dependencies
    - Will automatically remove unnecessary dependencies
    - Smarter dependency resolution
    - Both CLI and interactive interface
    - Better for system maintenance

5. SECURITY (AppArmor)
- What is it:
  * Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system
  * Restricts programs' capabilities
  * Profiles define what resources programs can access
  * Runs by default on Debian
- Benefits:
  * Additional security layer
  * Protects system resources
  * Reduces impact of security breaches

6. PASSWORD POLICY
- Importance:
  * First line of defense against unauthorized access
  * Prevents dictionary attacks
  * Enforces security best practices
- Implementation:
  * Password complexity rules
  * Regular password changes
  * Password history
  * Login attempt limits
- Trade-offs:
  * Security vs usability
  * Management overhead

7. SUDO AND UFW
- sudo:
  * Controlled administrative access
  * Detailed logging of commands
  * Fine-grained permission control
  * Security through limited exposure
- UFW:
  * Simple firewall configuration
  * Port access control
  * Network security management
  * Protection against unauthorized access

8. SSH
- Features:
  * Encrypted communication channel
  * Secure remote system access
  * File transfer capabilities
  * Port forwarding
- Security:
  * Key-based authentication
  * Custom port (4242) reduces automated attacks
  * No root login for better security
  * Encrypted data transfer

9. MONITORING SCRIPT
- Components:
  * Architecture type
  * CPU physical/virtual
  * Memory usage
  * Disk usage
  * CPU load
  * Last boot
  * LVM usage
  * TCP connections
  * User log
  * Network IP
  * Sudo commands
- Cron:
  * Task scheduler
  * Runs script every 10 minutes
  * Broadcasts using wall
  * Configurable timing
  
# ====== FTP Server (File Transfer Protocol) ======

1. WHAT IS FTP?
- Basic Definition:
  * Protocol for transferring files between computers
  * Client-server architecture
  * Standard network protocol
  * Uses port 21 by default

2. PURPOSE
- Main Uses:
  * Upload files to server
  * Download files from server
  * Manage remote files
  * Share files between systems

3. HOW IT WORKS
- Components:
  * FTP Server (vsftpd in our case)
  * FTP Client
  * Control Connection (commands)
  * Data Connection (file transfer)

4. ADVANTAGES
- Benefits:
  * Simple to use
  * Fast file transfers
  * Supports large files
  * User authentication
  * Directory management

5. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- Important Points:
  * Password protection
  * User permissions
  * Firewall rules (port 21)
  * File access control
  * Encrypted transfers (FTPS)

6. VSFTPD (Very Secure FTP Daemon)
- Features:
  * Default FTP server for Debian
  * Security focused
  * Easy to configure
  * Good performance
